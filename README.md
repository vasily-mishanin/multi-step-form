## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [ ] Complete each step of the sequence

- [ ] Go back to a previous step to update their selections

- [ ] See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order

- [ ] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size

- [ ] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

- [ ] Receive form validation messages if:

- [ ] A field has been missed

- [ ] The email address is not formatted correctly

- [ ] A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

### What I learned

In this challenge I've learned how to build multistep form.
I wrapped it into single component StepForm. This StepForm wrapped two another components: StepsSection and Form.
StepsSection - for displaying steps.
Form - wrapper for form and controls
There is just one single form.
I build useMultiStepForm custom hook to manage steps and subforms, which are rendered inside form. These subform are just various inputs in special wrapper;
The state management is being made inside StepForm;
Each Input.. component from subforms independently validates and updates the state via props callbacks.
Next disabling managed by forms iAmValid functions, logic is different.

### Continued development

Finished for now
